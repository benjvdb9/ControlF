-Unable to look for words above 100 chars

=> Problem solved by using fgets instead of scanf due to
fgets innate overflow protection. Also allows for whitespaces!
according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1247989/how-do-you-allow-spaces-to-be-entered-using-scanf

-Ã© is a wide character and as such breaks the rule that all char's size is 1.
This causes the column position on some lines to be wrong but will be ignored
seeing as it is not worth the hassle and seemingly a fairly complex issue.

-Cannot use the program to create a file. Set the mode on 0777 to allow everyone
all the rights but on file creation it still does not allow permission to read 
the file. Create a file with touch and then write into it afterwards.
=>Problem solved by setting mode directly instead of using mode flags.
